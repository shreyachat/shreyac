Hi, I’m Shreya Chatterjee, a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst and Data Scientist with a Master's in Applied Statistics and Analytics from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University (2023). My journey in data began with a strong foundation in statistical reasoning, which I’ve expanded into hands-on experience with **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning, Deep learning Artificial Inteligence**.

🔍 I love exploring data, discovering insights, and transforming raw numbers into meaningful stories. I've completed industry internships and professional roles in data analysis, and I’m currently upskilling in machine Learning, Business Intelligence, Deep learning and AI to broaden my impact.

💼 I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in data analytics, data science, or consulting roles where I can apply my skills in a challenging, real-world environment.

📈 My GitHub features projects on EDA, dashboarding in Excel/Power BI, ML models, and automation — with more coming soon!
